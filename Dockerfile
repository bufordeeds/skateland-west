# Migrator stage: same base as the runner, but preserves the Payload CLI
# and its transitive deps (cross-env, payload binary, tsx, etc) that the
# Next standalone tracer strips out of the runner image. The deploy
# workflow publishes this as a second tag (`:<sha>-migrator`) and runs it
# as a one-off container to apply pending Payload migrations BEFORE the
# live service container is swapped, so a failing migration aborts the
# deploy instead of leaving a half-migrated DB.
